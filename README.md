# Simple-Password-Project
A simple python command line password generator

The generator takes in the name of the the website and the
first or last name of the user to generate a complexyet easy 
to remember password. Many generators create these long and intricate
passwords that are secure and close to impossible to crack. However
this creates the need for the password to be written down or stored
through a third party system which inevitably reduces how secure
the password actually is. 

The password generator I created outputs two passswords:
a decrypted and an encrypted. The decrypted utlizes the
random function along with the NATO Phonetic alphabet to create
a password that is easy to remember and relates to its inteded website
through the shared first character. The decrypted also utilizes
the ASCII sum of the users name to create add complexion but also create
a shared key for the users other passwords. This number can be remembered
or recalculated using the ASCII table.

This is just a simple project I made to help me learn python better.
